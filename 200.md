# 200 OK

The 200 (OK) status code indicates that the request has succeeded. The content sent in a 200 response depends on the request method. For the methods defined by this specification, the intended meaning of the content can be summarized as:

| Request method | Response content in a representation of ... |
| --- | --- |
| GET | the [target resource][target-resource] |
| HEAD | the [target resource][target-resource], like GET, but without transferring the representation data |
| POST | the status of, or results obtained from, the action |
| PUT, DELETE | the status of the action |
| OPTIONS | communication options for the target resource |
| TRACE | the request message as received by the server returning the trace |

[target-resource]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#target.resource

Aside from responses to CONNECT, a 200 response is expected to contain message content unless the message framing explicitly indicates that the content has zero length. If some aspect of the request indicates a preference for no content upon success, the origin server ought to send a 204 (No Content) response instead. For CONNECT, there is no content because the successful result is a tunnel, which begins immediately after the 200 response header section.

A 200 response is heuristically cacheable; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls ([RFC 9111 on _Freshness_](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-4.2)).

In 200 responses to GET or HEAD, an origin server SHOULD send any available validator fields ([Section 8.8 of RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-8.8)) for the selected representation, with both a strong entity tag and a Last-Modified date being preferred.

In 200 responses to state-changing methods, any validator fields ([Section 8.8 of RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-8.8)) sent in the response convey the current validators for the new representation formed as a result of successfully applying the request semantics. Note that the PUT method ([Section 9.3.4 of RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-9.3.4)) has additional requirements that might preclude sending such validators.
